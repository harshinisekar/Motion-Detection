# Motion-Detection
 This Python project uses OpenCV to capture live video from a webcam and detect motion in real-time. It records the start and end times of detected motion and saves them in a CSV file. The project is ideal for basic security systems or monitoring activities, providing a simple yet effective motion detection solution.
